# Mockup 
This is where I was sketching the idea of the game, I made the mockup in Photoshop.

# Plan
First thing I did was to think about the game idea, then I gathered up all the features I want in game.
Next I was thinking of how would I make the game, I researched about JavaScript libraries to make games and Phaser was the recommended library that I choose.
Then, I was learning how to use Phaser using tutorials to learn about Collisions, Spirtesheets, Scenes, Effects, etc. in order to make my game.
